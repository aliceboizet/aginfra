## Phenotyping experiments data analysis

### Presentation of Plant Phenotyping 
à quoi ça sert ?... quelles données ? (10 min)
parler de PHIS ici (15 min)

### Breeding API  (10 min)
<img src="./img/brapi_logo_final2_368x80.png" width="100" />  

The Breeding API (BrAPI) is an API standard specified for plant phenotype/genotype databases to serve their data to crop breeding applications (see [https://brapi.org/](https://brapi.org/)). 
Several phenotyping data providers have implemented in their system some web services which are BrAPI compliant.
The main advantage is that you can retrieve data from all of these servers with the same call (only the url server is changing).


### OpenSILEX-PHIS 
OpenSILEX is an ontology-driven Information System designed for life science data. It is developped by INRA and is opensource.
Based on OpenSILEX, an application for plant phenomics has been developped : PHIS for Phenotyping Information System. PHIS has been enriched with BrAPI compliant web services in order to retrieve observations data.

### VRE Food Security
## Food Security VRE objectives

The Food Security VRE is a tool for plant phenotyping researchers to collaborate and share data, data analysis treatment. It is a virtual working environment with different tools that researchers are used to work with to analyze their data but it also provides tools to facilitate the collaboration in the community (datasets and analytics processes sharing, graphical charts sharing).
 
This VRE is designed for plant scientists and more specifically phenotyping scientists to give them easy access to data from several phenotyping platforms and to provide them data analytics and visualization tools. 

It is accessible here: [https://aginfra.d4science.org/group/foodsecurity](https://aginfra.d4science.org/group/foodsecurity)


The aim of the Food Security VRE is first to give easy access to plant phenotyping data from PHIS but also others BrAPI compliant databases. After getting data, the VRE users can analyze, visualize the data by reusing analytics scripts or workflows or they can also design their own workflows and share them to the community.
An other important part of the research in plant science is the terminology and the semantics. That is why some semantics tools have been added to the VRE so that the users can visualize domain ontologies.
